The project "Classification of Multiple Diseases by applying technique of Random Forest " aims to leverage machine learning for the early detection and diagnosis of various diseases. The system utilizes the Random Forest algorithm, a robust and versatile machine learning model, to analyze clinical and demographic data and predict the likelihood of conditions such as Diabetes, Heart Disease, Lung Cancer, and Parkinson's Disease. The project involves several key components, including data collection, preprocessing, model training, and a user-friendly web interface for data input and result visualization. A comprehensive dataset was employed, with careful feature selection and data preprocessing to ensure model accuracy and reliability. The system's web interface, developed using Django, allows users to input their medical data and receive instant predictions, presented in an intuitive and accessible format. The model's performance is assessed using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, demonstrating high efficacy in disease prediction. This project highlights the potential of machine learning in transforming healthcare diagnostics, offering a cost-effective and efficient solution for early disease detection. It also sets the stage for future enhancements, such as expanding the range of diseases covered, improving model accuracy, and integrating with electronic health records (EHR) systems. By providing actionable insights and facilitating early intervention, this system has the potential to significantly improve patient outcomes and support healthcare professionals in making informed clinical decisions.
